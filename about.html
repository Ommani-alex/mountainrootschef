      <h2>Welcome</h2>

With over 13 years of experience, I craft refined Appalachian cuisine and fresh, small-batch baked goods inspired by heritage and heart. From cozy, chef-prepared dinners to crave-worthy treats like handmade carrot cakes and chocolate bars, everything I make is personalized and thoughtfully sourced.

      <h2>About David</h2>
      <p>I come from the mountains of Western North Carolina, where the land is rich, the seasons shape the table, and tradition runs deep. My grandfather and great-grandfather were a big part of my life, and the time I spent with them shaped who I am—especially as a chef.</p>
      <p>They taught me what real hard work looks like. I spent my childhood helping in the garden, splitting wood, gathering eggs, preserving summer’s bounty, and roaming the woods digging ramps. My great-grandfather was a man of many trades—he was a bear hunter, a moonshiner, a WWII veteran, a mica miner, and he even grew tobacco. He embodied resilience and versatility, and I was always fascinated by his stories and the life he lived. He and my grandfather showed me what it meant to be tough, resourceful, and proud of your work.</p>
      <p>Their influence shaped my work ethic and my passion for food. With over 13 years in the culinary world—from local kitchens to high-end dining and private chef experiences—I bring those Appalachian values into everything I do. At Mountain Roots Catering, I specialize in refined Appalachian cuisine—honoring the flavors of my heritage while adding my own creative touch.</p>
      <p>Every dish I create carries a piece of where I’m from. It’s more than just cooking—it’s storytelling, memory, and a tribute to the men who taught me the meaning of hard work.</p>
