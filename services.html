      <h2>Private Chef Services</h2>
      <p>I'm Chef David Breeden of Mountain Roots Catering. With 13 years of experience in the culinary industry—ranging from country clubs and restaurants to casinos and allergy-conscious meal prep—I bring creative, custom dining experiences into your home or event space.</p>
      <p>While my specialty is refined Appalachian cuisine, I craft everything from comforting classics to globally inspired fine dining. Every meal is tailored to your tastes, preferences, and dietary needs.</p>

      <h3>Booking & Payment</h3>
      <p>To reserve a date, I require an $80 retainer. Once paid, your date is locked in. Seven days before the event, you'll receive your final invoice, which must be paid before service. A $50 travel fee applies to all bookings. Please use the secure Square checkout link below to complete payment.</p>
