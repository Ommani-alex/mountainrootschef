      <h2>Personal Chef Services</h2>
      <p>I'm Chef David Breeden with Mountain Roots Catering. I have 13 years of experience in the culinary industry, working in small local restaurants, casinos serving famous musical acts, VIPs, and high rollers, country clubs, and for elderly clients and those with allergens. My diverse background allows me to create exceptional, customized dining experiences tailored to your unique needs.</p>
      <p>My focus is on upscale Appalachian cuisine, but I can cook anything you can think of—from global gourmet dishes to comforting down-home cooking.</p>
      <h3>Booking & Payment</h3>
      <p>To book a meal, I require a $80 retainer. Once paid, your date is locked in. Seven days before your event, I will send a final invoice, which must be paid in full before I arrive to cook. Payments can be made anytime between the retainer payment and seven days prior to your event. A $50 travel fee applies to all bookings.</p>
      <h3>Meal Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Starter Course: Appetizer, soup, or salad</li>
        <li>Main Course: Protein + two sides</li>
        <li>Final Course: Dessert or finger foods</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Pricing Tiers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>$55 per person: Mid-grade restaurant quality</li>
        <li>$65-$75 per person: Higher-end proteins and elevated flavors</li>

      <h3>Why Choose a Personal Chef?</h3>
